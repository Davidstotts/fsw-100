        Have you ever wanted to play Dungeons and Dragons but didn't know where to start? Well, you are in luck! On Sept 15 2020, we are holding an intro course to dnd for all ages! We have partnered with Wizards of the Coast, who have donated player hand books for all that attend, and we will be providing a set of dice to all that attend to help you on your path and future adventures! Bellow is the overview of the classes that will be going on throughout the day. There will also be vendors selling wares for those interrested. We will have several games to choose from at the end of the day to practice everything you have learned.
